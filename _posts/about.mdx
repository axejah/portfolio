# About Kevin
Hi üëã 

I am a self-taught developer located in Zaandam, the Netherlands. The passion to start coding grew on me over time, after working close to developers for several years. Currently specialized in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Familiar and worked with frameworks like React and NodeJS. For styling and prototyping I prefer to use Bootstrap.
